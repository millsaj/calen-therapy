              Addictions and problematic habits are patterns of behavior that can feel extremely difficult to control
              despite negative consequences. They can involve substances like alcohol or drugs, or behaviors such as
              gambling, gaming, or other compulsive activities. What often begins as a way to cope, feel pleasure,
              or escape discomfort can develop into a cycle that significantly impacts your wellbeing.
            </p>
            <p>
              These patterns aren't simply about willpower or moral failing. They involve complex changes in the brain's
              reward and motivation systems, alongside psychological, social, and sometimes genetic factors. Though
              challenging, recovery is absolutely possible with the right support and approaches that address not just
              the behaviors themselves but also the underlying issues and triggers.

              Addiction and problematic habits affect millions of people worldwide, yet many suffer in silence due to
              shame, stigma, or fear of judgment. These patterns can develop for various reasons:

              <li>Life transitions or challenges that overwhelm usual coping mechanisms</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Addictions and compulsive habits can include:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li>Alcohol dependency</li>
