              Life Coaching is a forward-focused, goal-oriented approach that helps you bridge the gap between where you are now and where you want to be. Unlike traditional therapy that may focus on healing past wounds, Life Coaching concentrates on creating actionable strategies for achieving specific personal and professional objectives.
            </p>
            <p>
              This dynamic process involves identifying your core values, clarifying your vision, overcoming obstacles, and developing concrete plans to move toward your desired future. Life Coaching empowers you to tap into your potential, increase self-awareness, and make meaningful changes that align with your authentic self and deepest aspirations.

              Life Coaching is particularly valuable when you're seeking structured support to achieve specific goals, navigate transitions, or enhance your overall quality of life. It provides accountability, perspective, and practical tools that accelerate your progress and help you overcome barriers to success.

              Life Coaching with Helen is a collaborative, structured process designed to help you achieve specific outcomes. Each session builds on previous progress and keeps you moving toward your defined goals.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-4'>
              During your sessions, you can expect:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">

            </ul>
            <p className='mb-4'>
              Between sessions, you'll typically work on agreed-upon action steps that move you closer to your goals. These "homework" assignments are a crucial part of the coaching process, as they help you implement new behaviors, test strategies, and build momentum.
