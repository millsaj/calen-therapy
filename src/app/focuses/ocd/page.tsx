              Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by unwanted, intrusive thoughts, images, or urges
              (obsessions) that cause significant distress, paired with repetitive behaviors or mental acts
              (compulsions) performed to reduce anxiety or prevent something bad from happening. Despite recognizing
              that these thoughts and behaviors are excessive, breaking free from the cycle can feel impossible
              without support.

              OCD can be remarkably complex and often misunderstood. While many associate it only with cleanliness or
              organisation, OCD can manifest in countless ways, often around a person's core values and greatest fears.
              With appropriate therapeutic interventions, however, people with OCD can experience significant relief
              and develop effective strategies for managing symptoms.

              OCD affects approximately 2-3% of the population, making it one of the more common mental health
              conditions. It typically begins in childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood and can significantly
              impact quality of life if left untreated.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              OCD manifests in various forms, with common themes including:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li><strong>Contamination and cleaning</strong> - Fears of germs, disease, or contamination leading to excessive washing or cleaning rituals</li>
              <li><strong>Checking behaviors</strong> - Repeated checking of locks, appliances, or other items due to fears of harm or disaster</li>
              <li><strong>Symmetry and ordering</strong> - Need for things to be arranged in perfect order or symmetry, often with magical thinking about consequences</li>
              <li><strong>Intrusive thoughts</strong> - Disturbing, unwanted thoughts about harm, violence, or taboo subjects (sometimes called "Pure O")</li>
              <li><strong>Scrupulosity</strong> - Obsessions related to religious or moral concerns</li>
              <li><strong>Relationship OCD</strong> - Persistent doubt and reassurance-seeking about relationships</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Various factors may contribute to the development of OCD:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li>Neurobiological factors affecting brain circuitry</li>
              <li>Genetic predisposition</li>
              <li>Personality traits like perfectionism or heightened responsibility</li>
              <li>Stressful life events or trauma</li>
              <li>Learning and behavioral reinforcement</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Many people with OCD struggle silently for years before seeking help, often developing elaborate systems
              to manage their symptoms. However, with specialized therapeutic approaches, significant improvement
              is possible.
