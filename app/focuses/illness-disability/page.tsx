              Living with a long-term illness or disability can affect every aspect of lifeâ€”physically, emotionally, and socially. The journey often involves adapting to new limitations, managing ongoing symptoms, and coping with changes in identity, relationships, and daily routines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therapy can provide a supportive space to process these changes, build resilience, and find meaning and hope, even in the face of ongoing challenges.
